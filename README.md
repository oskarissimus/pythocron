# Python + Cron = Pythocron

Purpose of this project is to enable simple scheduled code execution. It's like cloud functions + scheduler with jupyter-notebook-like interface and user-friendliness.


## Running
```
# Cloning repo
git clone https://github.com/oskarissimus/pythocron.git
cd pythocron

# Just docker-compose up :)
docker-compose up
```

Than go to http://localhost:5000

You can also use backend directly http://localhost:8000/docs

## Stopping
To stop, just exit `npm start` with `ctrl-c` and than stop backend with `docker stop pythocron-backend`

## General architecture
### Backend

Backend is written in Python 3.8 + Fastapi. Poetry is responsible for dependency management. Python-crontab provides python interface for cron management.

Backend is wrapped in docker image. It is based on python:3.8-slim-buster. Tini is utilized to solve problems with running two services in container (cron and uvicorn for fastapi)

After starting backend there are auto-generated interactive docs on `localhost:8000/docs`

### Frontend
Frontend is made in React js.
